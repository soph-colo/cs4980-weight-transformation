## Weight Transformation Mechanisms

### Abstract:


### Repository Architecture:

#### Tabular Data: The main analysis is contained here.
##### EDA: Initial investigation of data for mushroom_cleaned.csv
##### FCNN-Basics: Original investigation of Fully Connected Neural Networks with three different model architectures.
##### FCNN-AccurarcyIncrease: Second iteration to attempt to improve the accuracy of a FCNN.
##### FCNNLayers: Investigation into three different networks looking into one, five, and ten layer networks.
##### FCNNNeurons: Taking a five layer network but altering the number of neurons in the network.
##### FCNNNeuronsEpochs: From FCNNLayers, taking the five layer network and looking at weights throughout training in epochs.
##### FCNNVaryingNeuronsEpoch: From FCNNNeurons, taking the network and looking at weights throughout training in epochs.
##### AltDataNeuronsEpochs: From FCNNeuronsEpochs, taking the network and analysis and applying a new dataset to it.
##### AltVaryingNeuronsEpoch: From FCNNVaryingNeuronsEpoch, taking the network and analysis and applying a new dataset to it.
